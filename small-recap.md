# Recap of naming
- File names named as function names - need to use nouns such that it gives an indication of the concepts or content. For ex. get_color_and_pair_number.py , here the file name used is like a function name.
- Funtion names should be indicating an action or what it does. ex. ColorCatalogue() could be named as PrintColorCatalogue()
- Good attempt to write segregated API vs implementation , and well named functions/files - [ex](https://github.com/clean-code-craft-tcq-3/well-named-in-cpp-Veeresh-Ranjan/pull/1/files
)
